Numerical guessing game
 </h1>
Project description: The program generates a random number in the range from 1 to n and asks the user to guess this number. If the user's guess is greater than a random number, then the program should output the message 'Too much, try again'. If the guess is less than a random number, then the program should output the message 'Too little, try again'. If the user guesses the number, the program should congratulate him and display a message 'You guessed it, congratulations!'.
